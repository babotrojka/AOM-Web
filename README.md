# AOM-Web

This is a more complex web application I made for my mountaineering society. It has multiple functions including user handling, articles handling, app for equipment storage and so on.

App was written using **Java servlet** technology.

App is currently online and can be reached on http://www.alp.zagreb-matica.hr/ao. Feel free to take a look and let me know if you have any suggestions :)
